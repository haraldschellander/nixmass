=========================================
     
Changes: 

* Large preallocated matrices for keeping track of the main variables have been replaced by small matrices. They only three timesteps, i.e. timestep - 1, timestep, and timestep + 1. Thi smakes computation much faster, and there is no more restriction of the data series length.
