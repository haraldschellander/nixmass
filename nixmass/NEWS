nixmass v1.0-2 (released ate: 2021-03-05)
=========================================
     
Changes: 

* Large preallocated matrices for keeping track of the main variables have been replaced by small matrices. They comprise of only three timesteps, i.e. timestep - 1, timestep, and timestep + 1. This makes computation much faster, and there is no more restriction of the data series length.
* The summary function has now a prettier output.
